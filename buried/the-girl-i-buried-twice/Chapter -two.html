      She feels a bit relieved after exiting the cafe. She convinces herself that it was all in her mind. As she was thinking about all this, she felt a tap on her shoulder. She turns, only to come face to face with the man from the cafe. Her heart drops. </br>
      “Miss.” The man speaks as he catches his breath. “I ran here to apologize. I notice that I might have scared you back there. I am really sorry. I had mistaken you for someone I know.” He continues. </br>
      “Oh no problem at all.” She smiles. “Thank you for letting me know, I feel quite relieved now that I know. You ran all the way to tell me?” She asks with a confused tone. </br>
      “Yes, after I came back to my senses, I realised how uncomfortable I might have made you back then.” </br>
      “Okay, thank you so much.” </br>

“Safe travels miss.” </br>

The man turns, and runs back to the cafe. Cassie remains standing shocked by what just occurred. Her phone ringing brings her back to reality. She checks the caller ID, it's her mother. </br>
“Hey baby, how are you?” She asks. </br>
“Oh mom, I wasn't expecting your call. I am okay, i just finished doing my interview now.” </br>
“And?! How did it go?” She asks nervously. </br>
“Good. I think it went well. I answered all the questions they asked me, confidently.” </br>
